#Mere Christianity
The book by C. S. Lewis

##About This Repository

This repository is a study-resource for the book Mere Christianity. It is meant to be used to study about 2 Chapters per week from the book. It does not contain a study-guide as such, but I may add this later if we decide to write one, or if anyone else has one they want to add?

Currently we are using a Study Guide we found on Amazon, which seems to be fairly up-to-date and fairly relevant to the social climate of 2014: http://www.amazon.com/Mere-Christianity-Discussion-Study-Guide/dp/1479169838
